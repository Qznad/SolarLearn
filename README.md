## Authentication System

SolarLearn uses **LocalStorage** to simulate user authentication:

- Users can create an account
- Login state persists across pages
- UI elements update dynamically based on login status
- Certain planet content is restricted to logged-in users

This approach was chosen to focus on JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.
