            <p class="user-only">
                The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is the main source of energy for life on Earth.

                Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun. Its surface is rocky and heavily cratered, with extreme temperature swings—from scorching heat during the day to freezing cold at night. Mercury has no atmosphere to protect it from the Sun’s rays or meteoroid impacts.

                Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System, covered in thick clouds of sulfuric acid. Its runaway greenhouse effect makes the surface hotter than Mercury, despite being further from the Sun. Venus rotates slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets.

      <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System, a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its Great Red Spot is a massive storm, and it has many moons that orbit around it.

            <p>
                Saturn is known for its spectacular ring system, made of ice, rock, and dust. Like Jupiter, it is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has more than 80 moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane. Saturn’s low density makes it the only planet in our Solar System that could float in water!

            <p>
                Uranus is an ice giant with a striking blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere. Unlike most planets, Uranus rotates on its side, giving it extreme seasonal variations. It has faint rings and 27 known moons. Uranus is very cold, with temperatures dropping below -200°C, making it one of the coldest planets in the Solar System.

            <p>
                Neptune is another ice giant, famous for its deep blue color and supersonic winds, the fastest in the Solar System. It has 14 known moons, including Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation. Neptune is far from the Sun, which means it receives very little sunlight and has a very cold, dynamic atmosphere.
